<h2 align="center">🎯 The Problem</h2>

<p align="center">
Learning to code is hard. Students practicing on platforms like LeetCode face a common dilemma:
</p>

- **Get stuck?** Traditional platforms offer hints or nothing at all
- **Use ChatGPT?** It gives you the full solution (learning: zero)
- **Pay for tutoring?** Expensive and time-limited
- **Use online AI tools?** Privacy concerns, API costs pile up, and you're dependent on internet connectivity

**The result?** Students either give up or copy-paste solutions without learning the underlying problem-solving patterns.
